  <li>Submit Project Report at Canvas and bring a hardcopy in the class. (Use IEEE Conference <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">template</a>, <a href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/conference-template-letter.docx">US letter</a> (DOC), <a href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/conference-template-a4.docx">A4</a>&nbsp;(DOC, 30 KB) <strong></strong>)</li>

  <li>Format 

    <p>-  Project Title, Names of group members,  Faculty Name, affliation, etc..</p>

    <p>- <strong>Abstract</strong> Section: Need of the work, why this project is important? What does this VR environment show? Who will benifit from this project?</p>

    <p>- I. <strong>Introduction</strong> Section: Goals and Objectives of the project,  The report should describe the designed environment . The different aspects of your environment, etc.  (Include images with figure number and title). Who will be using the VR Application (Target audience)? What were you intending to do? Why are you doing it? Why is this application usefull? </p>
        <p>- II. <strong>Related work</strong> Section: a discussion of related work along at least 7 (max. 25) scientific references (i.e., scientific papers not blog articles or websites), an overview of what exactly your project is about and what others have done similar to the work you have proposed or done.</p>
  -III. <strong>Implementation</strong> Section-  Include a system architecure diagram (User interaction with Unity/vizard client) showing different phases of implemenation (for example: Sub sections such as: modelling phase, exporting to Unity/vizard/Unreal phase, adding behaviors, scripts and fucntionality for interactivity, etc.)
  <p>-<strong>IV. Functionality Section</strong>: Describe each required functionality with text and images. (check below for  functionality elements). Add Print screen images for important details implemented, Include each image with figure number and title. Results and discussion section is OPTIONAL.</p>
    <p>-<strong> V. Conclusion</strong> Section: Summarize what you have implemented and why?  Why is this VR application usefull? Who will use this VR application? What are the benifits of this application. Explain problems encountered and remaining shortcomings (Future Work)? </p>
  -<strong>Acknowledgement</strong> Section: material copied from other sites (for e.g modles, scripts, etc.). Clearly include links that point to other websites. Acknowledge mentor, faculty advisor, etc.</li>

  <li> <strong>GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</strong>: List  the goal and Objectives of the project. [For example evacuation 
    
    behavior simulation, plane take-off simulation, hazardous events, reconstruction 
    
    or remodeling of a building, etc.] <br>
    
    MODELING: Describe the built VR environment (building, trees, people, 
    
    furniture, landscaping elements, etc.)<br>
    
    o Planned geometry, use of textures, animations, behavior and functionality, 
    
    etc.<br>
    
    o Describe how the application will be used. (envisioned users, navigation, interactions, etc.)<br>
    o Explain the modeling done in 3ds Max or google sketchup<br>
    
  PROGRAMMING: Explain how you used python programming (Vizard) or C#/java programming (Unity 3D) [use print screen image]</li>
  
  <li><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

     normal'><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Functionality: Explain how the   following were implemented: (add print screen images to explain each)</span></b>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Vision</strong>: Use of textures       and 3D models to provide detailed information in the project.</li>
      <li><strong>Sound</strong>: Use speech, music       or ambient sounds to help provide information about this place.</li>
      <li><strong>Animation</strong>: Use at least       three animated objects in the project.</li>
      <li><strong>Interactivity</strong>: Use at       least five user-triggered events in the project.</li>
      <li><strong>Characters/Avatars</strong>:  Have animated agents (path following behavior) in the environment. (with key board/button trigger)</li>
      <li><strong>Sensors</strong>:  Use at least three different types of sensors (Proximity, Time, Touch, etc.) in the project. </li>
      <li><strong>Player</strong>:  Add a Player Controller to the Scene: First Person Controller or 3rd Person  Controller</li>
      <li><strong>AI Implementation:</strong> AI functionality depending upon the project (navigation, behaviors, shortest  path, etc.), implement different behaviors (selfish, altruistic, learning,  adaptive, etc.) in the environment through a user menu (number of agent&rsquo;s  assignment).</li>
      <li><strong>Interface elements</strong>:  Design the interface that include menu items such as buttons, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-User Environment</strong> OR <strong>Hardware Integration</strong> OR Mobile Version (with <a href="https://youtu.be/gcsnY2824Ho">Joystick for navigation</a>): More than two people to be present in the same environment. Hardware can be metaquest, htc vive, HoloLens, smart phone, etc.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Explain  <span class="MsoNormal">the behaviors implemented for different agents/avatars </span>(By including screen shots)</li>
