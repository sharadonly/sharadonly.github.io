    <h2><strong><font color="#ff9933">1. &nbsp; Purpose and Method</font></strong></h2>

    <div align="justify">

      <p>The purpose of the course  project is to provide the students with the knowledge of software  engineering methodology and the skills to apply it. The project  consists of <strong>two iterations</strong>, both focused around the <em>same</em> software product. The first iteration is <em>exploratory</em> and represents  the first attempt at developing the proposed software product. The  instructor will provide feedback and the students should reconsider  and possibly revise the project goals before going on to the second  iteration.  Keep in mind that it's  acceptable to modify your  objective in the middle of the semester, once you learn more about the  project and have better understanding of what you can accomplish  within the semester timeframe. </p>

      <p>Projects will also introduce students to team work, which is a most important for  large-scale software development. The challenge is to make possible group efforts that discern  contributions of each individual. The second <em>iteration</em> is development and also  includes revision of the project goals. The deliverables for the <strong>first and  second iteration</strong> are reports and demos.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2><strong><font color="#ff9933">2.   Team Work and Project Management</font></strong></h2>

    <div align="justify">

      <p>Each team consists of 2 to 3 students.  All students in a team work  on the same project. <em>Team work is <strong>required</strong> since team work  is an integral part of large-scale software development.</em></p>

      <p>You should form a team by <strong><font color="#ff9933">Sept 17</font></strong> 

        and <strong>notify by email</strong> the instructor about the following: 

      </p>

      <ol>

        <li> Team member names and email addresses </li>

        <li>Team leader name </li>

        <li> Project proposal </li>

      </ol>

      <p>All team members should be part of all project activities. Saying that "nobody asked me to do this or that, or, I did everything  that I was asked to do" is an <strong>unacceptable excuse</strong>. Each member should take the initiative to get the work done.

      Remember, <em>All team members are <strong>equally</strong> responsible for <strong>all</strong> aspects of the  project.</em></p>

    </div>

    <div align="justify"></div>

    <h4>What if your team is not functioning well?</h4>

    <div align="justify">

      <p> If you notice that your team does not function well or the team  leader tries to misuse his or her role, and this could negatively  impact your project performance, you should make every effort to  discuss this with other team members.  If the &ldquo;problematic&rdquo;  team members (including the team leader) refuse to cooperate, you  should discuss your concerns with the instructor. Complaints about poor team  functioning expressed at the end of semester will be <strong>ignored</strong>.</p>

    </div>

    <h2><strong><font color="#ff9933">3. Required Project Components</font></strong> </h2>

    <p>      The goal of the project is develop software -- for example,  an online auction, online book/music/video store, online backup service, online  collaboration service, etc. (use your imagination). Key components that the  project must include are: </p>

    <ol>

      <li><strong>Data Input</strong> <br>

        Mechanism of input, manual or read a  dataset from a file, or from a web site </li>

      <li><strong>Archiving</strong> <br>

        Examples include: SQL database  (e.g., mySQL), flat file, or an online data storage (search the Web) </li>

      <li><strong>Analysis</strong> <br>

        Such as data search (discovering  specific services/products among those available), sorting, regression  analysis, other statistical analysis, etc. (Explain what kind of data processing/analysis you will  do?) </li>

      <li><strong>Display</strong> <br>

        Visualization of the analysis  results using graphs and charts </li>

    </ol>

    <p><strong>Project Must Include Programming</strong> <br>

    </p>

    <p>Number of Stakeholders (users, mangers, etc.). Have atleast 3-4 actors for your project. </p>
    <p>Choose a target audience? The software should be targeted towards the audeince. Come up with a set of requirements and use case scenarios for each actor.</p>

    <p> When  deciding about the project, the most important thing to keep in mind is that  the software product you will develop should require lot of programming. &nbsp;Programming language, such as C, C++, Java, or  C# should be used.<br>

      Note: Designing web pages which contain <em>only</em> HTML is <em>not</em> programming. <br>

      Your  project <em>can</em> include web page design. But it should include designing  active webpages using AJAX, Flash, etc.</p>

    <p>It is a  good idea to review the <a href="demo1.htm">first demo</a> and <a href="demo2.htm">second demo</a> descriptions to see how your project  will be graded.<br>

    </p>

    <h4><strong>Choice of the Topic</strong> </h4>

    <p>Your project may or may not be Web based, but it must  include programming. </p>

    <p>You can develop a mobile application if it covers the above 4 reqirements (project components).</p>

    <h2><strong><font color="#ff9933">4. Proposal Format, Submission, and Feedback</font></strong></h2>

    <p><strong>Proposal Format</strong> <br>

      Each proposal should contain the following: </p>

    <ol>

      <li>Project title, Group number</li>

      <li>Team profile: </li>

      <ol>

        <li>Individual qualifications and  strengths (such as: programming, design, presentation, documentation,  management and organization) <br>

          Note: It is expected that every team member would be involved in all project  activities</li>

        <li>Name of the elected team leader<br>

          Note: The team leader should act as catalyst, to organize group meetings and keep  track of activities.</li>

      </ol>

      <li><strong>Proposed project description</strong></li>

      <ol>

        <li>If you are proposing one of the  projects described in class or elsewhere on internet, write down the project  name (with link as reference) and describe briefly, how you plan to modify the  project.<br>

        </li>

        <li>If you are proposing your own idea  for a project, your project description must have the level of detail <br>

          Make sure to include the following: </li>

        <ol>

          <li>Statement of the goal</li>

          <li>List of the services to be provided  by the proposed system. For each feature that you propose, write the details of  how you plan to execute them. Also list the software used.</li>

          <li>Description of the <strong>programming</strong> part of your project. </li>

          <li>Description of the typical customers.  Also give a scenario of a person who would be using your system. Why does he  need to use the system? What features will he used to get his/her work done?</li>

          <li>3-4 actors who would be using the software. An example user profile of an actor. </li>

          <li>Describe how Key components of the  project will be implemented in terms of Data Input, Archiving, Analysis, and Display</li>

        </ol>

      </ol>

    </ol>

    <p>The  document should be prepared on a computer. </p>
